  ## Description 
  This command-line application takes information about employees on a software engineering team and then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each employee. The HTML webpage is generated by user input using Inquirer. 

  When a user clicks on an email address in the HTML the default email programs opens and populates the To field of the email with the address. 

  When a user clicks on the GibHub username, the GitHub profile opens in a new tab.

  The following technologies were used to create this application
  - Node.JS
  - Inquirer 
  - Jest
